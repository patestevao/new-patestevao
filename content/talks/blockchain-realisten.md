## About the interview

This is an interview I gave to the channel Blockchain Realisten during the Building on Bitcoin Conference (July, 2018). We spoke about the subject of [my talk in the event](/talks/designing-lightning-wallets), the Bitcoin Lightning Network, as well as about my general views of how UX should be faced on a complex system such as Bitcoin.
