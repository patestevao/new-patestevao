## About the talk

This talk was part of the conference Advancing Bitcoin, which happened on February 8th, 2019, in London.

The full name of the talk was *"Advancing the Bitcoin User Experience: Designing for developers and end users"* and its intention was to communicate key design principles and how they apply when designing for a cryptocurrency system. I also highlight the importance of creating usable solutions both for novice and highly technical users, such as the developers themselves.

I've made the [keynote for this talk available](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cmINRM49Z49LHZU0eWpOojUlfjzdyF1R/view?usp=sharing), but you can also watch the full talk:
