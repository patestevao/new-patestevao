## About the video

This video brought together two different interests of mine: it was my first attempt at a full scripted and narrated short animation, and it talks about privacy in the light and friendly manner that I think is in order to avoid the heavy connotations this subject sometimes is associated with.

The script was created by [Marco Agner](https://www.marcoagner.com/), while the art, animation and narration were my responsibilities.

I used Adobe Illustrator for the artwork and Adobe After Effects for the animation.
