## About the talk

This talk was presented at the conference Building on Bitcoin on July 3rd, 2018, in Lisbon.

The full name of the talk as *"Designing Lightning wallets for the Bitcoin user"* and it focused on the expected design challenges for this new concept of Bitcoin wallets â€” the lightning wallets. A new learning curve will be imposed to users beyond the already existing complexities that were abstracted in the form of metaphors in the most simple forms of Bitcoin wallets.
